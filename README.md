# beautify.chocmxin

A mixin for [Chocolat](http://www.chocolatapp.com) to pretty-format Javascript, HTML and CSS using JSBeautify.

Adds `Beautify` menu to Chocolat's `Action` Menu. 

To pretty-format the current document, use `alt-ctrl-cmd-j`. Will auto-detect the language of your current document and apply your current settings for that language if supported.


Implements GUI access to the complete set of options of JSBeautify for all supported languages:
